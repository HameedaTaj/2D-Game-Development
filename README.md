Project description:FairyLand

About the project: My goal is to have a FairyLand game.This has 3 backgrounds, which moves in varing speeds.Player is the Fairy, it can fly up,down,right and left based on the user input. Fairy should collect the Magic flower to increase the score and also kill the enemy butterflies. Fairy can shoot bullets to kill the enemies.Painters algorithm is used to show bigger and smaller  butterflies in the background. 
  	Once the Fairy reaches the end, it should kill the devil to safegaurd the little princess. Fairy has 3 lifes. This also includes the God mode, to test the game.

Features implemented:
Bullet Pool
Explosion
Collision
PainterAlgorithm
Sound
HelpMenu
GameOverBox

 Challenges: I did add lights to my project, but it was not relevant to the game, and was not convincing. Hence i have removed the code.Also, i tried to use fluidsim, I am using VM and Nvidia Cuda toolkit 8 was not available for Ubuntu 14.04. Hence had to drop the plan.
